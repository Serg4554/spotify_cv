# Hello Spotify, I'm Serg
![Spotify logo](spotify_logo.png)
This is a small project to show who I am, what my knowledge is and the projects to which I have dedicated more time until now, beginnings of 2019. The intention is to describe it in a fun and entertaining way, using the Spotify API to accompany with music a series of games that will provide more information about who I am.

# Purpose
The sole purpose of this project is to make Spotify's recruiters work more entertaining and allow them to see (even superficially) the deep interest I have in working with such amazing people and dedicate my hours to improve even more a product that already is incredible.

# Check it out
You can check out this project without having a Spotify Premium account, but I recommend using it with an account to fully enjoy the experience. C'mon isn't expensive, don't be stingy ðŸ˜‰
